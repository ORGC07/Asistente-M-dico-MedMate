Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass $o {\n  constructor(\n  /**\n   * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n   * access to local persistence.\n   */\n  t, e, n, s, i, r, o, u, c,\n  /**\n   * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

When using composite filters, you cannot use more than one filter at the top level. Consider nesting the multiple filters within an `and(...)` statement. For example: change `query(query, where(...), or(...))` to `query(query, and(where(...), or(...)))`.\");\n  }\n  /**\n  * @license\n  * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n  *\n  * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n  * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n  * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n  *\n  *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n  *\n  * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n  * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n  * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n  * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n  * limitations under the License.\n  */\n  /**\n  * Converts Firestore's internal types to the JavaScript types that we expose\n  * to the user.\n  *\n  * @internal\n  */(s);\n  for (const e of s) t = e._apply(t);\n  return t;\n}\n\n/**\n * A `QueryFieldFilterConstraint` is used to narrow the set of documents returned by\n * a Firestore query by filtering on one or more document fields.\n * `QueryFieldFilterConstraint`s are created by invoking {@link where} and can then\n * be passed to {@link query} to create a new query instance that also contains\n * this `QueryFieldFilterConstraint`.\n */\nclass ul extends rl {\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  constructor(t, e, n) {\n    super(), this._field = t, this._op = e, this._value = n, /** The type of this query constraint */\n    this.type = \"where\";\n  }\n  static _create(t, e, n) {\n    return new ul(t, e, n);\n  }\n  _apply(t) {\n    const e = this._parse(t);\n    return vl(t._query, e), new Wa(t.firestore, t.converter, En(t._query, e));\n  }\n  _parse(t) {\n    const e = kh(t.firestore),\n      n = function (t, e, n, s, i, r, o) {\n        let u;\n        if (i.isKeyField()) {\n          if (\"array-contains\" /* Operator.ARRAY_CONTAINS */ === r || \"array-contains-any\" /* Operator.ARRAY_CONTAINS_ANY */ === r) throw new L(B.INVALID_ARGUMENT, `Invalid Query.
